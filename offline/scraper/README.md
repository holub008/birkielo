# About
Scraping, processing, and formatting ski results with requests, BeautifulSoup, and pandas.

Note this is my first project with pandas, coming from R DataFrames; I will likely be doing things suboptimally or with ugly code.

## Installation
Install depedencies using pipenv:
```sh
pipenv install
```

## Running
Scripts can also be run using pipenv, as in:
```sh
pipenv run python birkie_scraper.py
```
